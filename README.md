`notes:`

- some chakra stuff had to be pinned down for popover component function to work. not sure which one, but the default install at the time (2021 May) was:  
  `npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4`

- firebase config stored in local gitignored `.env` and env vars passed to host at deployment/runtime
